Identify the "proper" Route (HTTP Method + Path)

Create the UI (<a> or <form>) that will send an HTTP request that matches that route.

Define the route on the server and map it to a controller action.

Code and export the controller action.

res.render a view in the case of a GET request, or res.redirect if data was changed. Write the view template if it does not already exist.
